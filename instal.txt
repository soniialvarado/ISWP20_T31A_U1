4. Add the JDK installation path to PATH (Windows only)
Windows searches the current directory and the directories listed in the PATH environment variable (system variable) for executable programs.

Open "Control Panel" -> "System" -> "Advanced system settings" -> "Environment Variables".
Under "System variables", scroll down to select "Path" and click "Edit...".
Append to the existing Path value a semi-colon ";" then the JDK's "bin" directory (e.g. ";C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-10.0.0\bin").


Verify IntelliJ Installation
Check that your IntelliJ is installed and up-to-date by following these steps below:

To check whether you need to install JDK, in a terminal window, type:
java -version
javac -version
If you do not have it, or do not have the latest version, download and install JDK.
Install IntelliJ. This course uses IntelliJ and we recommend you use the same IDE.
